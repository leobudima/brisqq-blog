With one of the capital’s [best same-day couriers](https://brisqq.com/blog/same-day-courier-london/)…

So, without further ado, let’s begin.

## How to Book a Delivery in London

[Brisqq](https://brisqq.com/) is London’s top courier service provider for business.

![brisqq couriers title cover](/blog/uploads/brisqq-couriers-title-cover.png "brisqq couriers title cover")

We specialize in both in-store and online delivery, which includes:

* Same-day delivery (in 1-hour time slots)
* Next-day or future-date scheduled delivery
* Multi-drop deliveries (in 1-hour time slots)
* Weekly, monthly, or yearly recurring deliveries
* Store-to-store transfers
* Returns and exchanges

That said:

Anyone can use our platform to book a delivery.

And the whole process couldn’t be simpler.

But to help you out, here’s our 7-step guide to book your first delivery with Brisqq:

### Step #1: Sign Up to Brisqq

To book a delivery with Brisqq, you need to open up an account.

You can do that on [this link](https://brisqq.com/sign-up).

You’ll reach our sign up page, where you can fill out our quick form:

![brisqq sign up form](/blog/uploads/brisqq-sign-up-form.png "brisqq sign up form")

Once done, all you have to do is click the _Sign Up_ button.

![brisqq sign up](/blog/uploads/brisqq-sign-up.png "brisqq sign up")

After that, you’ll receive an email with a confirmation link.

![brisqq account confirmation](/blog/uploads/brisqq-account-confirmation.png "brisqq account confirmation")

Clicking on the link in the email will finish the sign up process.

And that’s it.

You have now created your very own account on Brisqq.

### Step #2: Log Into Your Account

To log into your account, click [this link](https://partners.brisqq.com/#/login).

For this you can use any browser on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.

Here you need to enter your email address and password. And click the _Log In_ button.

![brisqq log in](/blog/uploads/brisqq-log-in.png "brisqq log in")

You’ll be automatically redirected to the home page of your account.

NOTE: You’ll receive the password in the confirmation email that we’ve sent you. The password is randomly generated. But you can change it inside the account settings menu.

### Step #3: Add the Pick-Up and Drop-off Address

This is what the _Homepage_ of your account looks like:

![brisqq delivery booking platform](/blog/uploads/brisqq-delivery-booking-platform.png "brisqq delivery booking platform")

At the top of the page, you’ll see two boxes.

One for the pick-up address. The other one for the drop-off address:

![adding delivery drop-off address](/blog/uploads/adding-delivery-drop-off-address.png "adding delivery drop-off address")

For one-off deliveries:

Add the drop-off address all you need to do is type it into the box and click _Find_.

If you have the exact address, all you have to do is select it.

If you have a general area like Trafalgar Square, you’ll be given several addresses in that area:

![adding delivery drop-off address 2](/blog/uploads/adding-delivery-drop-off-address-2.png "adding delivery drop-off address 2")

The pick-up address is automatically generated based on the business address in your account.

But if you click on the box, you can input and change the pick-up point:

![adding delivery drop-off address 3](/blog/uploads/adding-delivery-drop-off-address-3.png "adding delivery drop-off address 3")

Once you’ve added both addresses, you’ll see both addresses as pins on the map:

![pick-up and drop-off locations on map](/blog/uploads/pick-up-and-drop-off-locations-on-map.png "pick-up and drop-off locations on map")

And a box will appear to let you know whether Brisqq can deliver your parcel to that address.

Brisqq delivers exclusively in London, so…

If the box is green, all you have to do is click _Continue_ to move on to the next step:

![courier availability](/blog/uploads/courier-availability.png "courier availability")

If the box is red, unfortunately we won’t be able to deliver the parcel to that address since it’s outside our deliver zone:

![courier availability delivery zone](/blog/uploads/courier-availability-delivery-zone.png "courier availability delivery zone")

NOTE: You can contact our customer support team at this link. Our colleagues can check if they can manually book the delivery for you.

### Step #4: Customize Package Information

The next step is to provide us with more information about your delivery.

On this page, you can add the size of your package:

![parcel and package size](/blog/uploads/parcel-and-package-size.png "parcel and package size")

This helps us select the right delivery vehicle for your delivery.

You have the option of choosing five different sizes:

* **S** - weight: up to 3kg max. dimensions: 25x20x7cm
* **M** - weight: up to 6kg max. dimensions: 30x25x15cm
* **L** - weight: up to 25kg max. dimensions: 50x50x40cm
* **XL** - weight: up to 40kg max. dimensions: 120x75x60cm
* **XXL** - weight: up to 40kg max. dimensions: 180x100x80cm

Next, you’ll have to add the number of packages and the approximate order value:

![no. of orders + order value](/blog/uploads/no-of-orders-order-value.png "no. of orders + order value")

Optionally, you can also:

* Add insurance for your delivery
* Let us know whether it’s fragile
* Input the order/reference number

![delivery insurance and order no.](/blog/uploads/delivery-insurance-and-order-no.png "delivery insurance and order no.")

NOTE: We do not insure perishable goods. For more information visit our Claims Policy.

Finally, you need to schedule the delivery.

Add the delivery date. Select an available time slot. And the earliest time for courier pick-up:

![delivery scheduling](/blog/uploads/delivery-scheduling.png "delivery scheduling")

### Step #5: Add Contact Information

Adding contact information ensures that couriers have a person to call at pick-up and drop-off.

So you’ll need to add a contact for both sender and recipient:

![sender and recipient contact information](/blog/uploads/sender-and-recipient-contact-information.png "sender and recipient contact information")

Here, you can also add notes for additional instructions to our couriers:

![pick-up and drop-off notes](/blog/uploads/pick-up-and-drop-off-notes.png "pick-up and drop-off notes")

You can also instruct the courier what to do if you’re not available, or in case of [a failed delivery attempt](https://elogii.com/blog/delivery-attempt/). This includes leaving the parcel with a neighbour, in a safe place, or returning it to the pick-up location:

![return and failed delivery attempt options](/blog/uploads/return-and-failed-delivery-attempt-options.png "return and failed delivery attempt options")

Once you’re done, click _Continue_ again.

### Step #6: Delivery Details Confirmation

Finally, you have to check all the delivery details and confirm it [to schedule the delivery](https://elogii.com/blog/scheduled-delivery/):

![delivery details](/blog/uploads/delivery-details.png "delivery details")

If any of the information is incorrect, you can change it by moving back to a previous step:

![edit delivery information](/blog/uploads/edit-delivery-information.png "edit delivery information")

If everything is correct, you can proceed to schedule your delivery:

![schedule delivery 2](/blog/uploads/schedule-delivery-2.png "schedule delivery 2")

### Step #7: Delivery Booking Complete

Once you’ve clicked on the _Schedule delivery_ button, your delivery booking is completed:

![delivery booking confirmation](/blog/uploads/delivery-booking-confirmation.png "delivery booking confirmation")

Here you have a couple of options, including printing out the delivery label:

![delivery booking label](/blog/uploads/delivery-booking-label.png "delivery booking label")

Or going to the _Delivery Details_ page to review your delivery booking:

![delivery booking details](/blog/uploads/delivery-booking-details.png "delivery booking details")

You’ll also receive an email confirmation in your _Inbox_:

![delivery booking email confirmation](/blog/uploads/delivery-booking-email-confirmation.png "delivery booking email confirmation")

## Canceling Your Delivery

With Brisqq, you can cancel your delivery for free for whatever reason.

You can cancel the booking within 15 minutes after scheduling it.

Or 60 minutes before pick-up for one-off time slot delivery.

To do this:

Go to your _Delivery Page_ and click _Cancel_ at the bottom of the page:

![delivery cancelation](/blog/uploads/delivery-cancelation.png "delivery cancelation")

And then just confirm the cancellation:

![delivery booking cancelation](/blog/uploads/delivery-booking-cancelation.png "delivery booking cancelation")

That’s it.

In case, you simply want to edit or correct any of the information, you don’t have to cancel the delivery.

All you have to do is:

Click the _Edit_ button at the bottom of your _Delivery Page_:

![delivery booking editting](/blog/uploads/delivery-booking-editting.png "delivery booking editting")

And the platform will return you to start of the booking process (Step #3).

## Tracking Your Delivery

To track your delivery with Brisqq, click on the tracking icon in the main menu:

![delivery tracking](/blog/uploads/delivery-tracking.png "delivery tracking")

You’ll get access to the live map, where you can see upcoming pick-ups and live deliveries.

You can stay on top of the [estimated time of arrival](https://elogii.com/blog/estimated-time-of-arrival-eta/), as the location is updated in real-time.
