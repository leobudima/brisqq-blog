[{"categories":[],"contents":"Thinking about going with CitySprint for your delivery?\nOr perhaps you’re looking to switch to a better courier service in London?\nWe’ve got you covered.\nIn this article, we’re going to show you a thorough assessment of 3 best CitySprint alternatives.\nIncluding a review of CitySprint’s pros and cons. (If you still want to take that path, instead.)\nSo you can choose a courier service provider that’s the best match for your business in London.\nLet’s start.\nCitySprint Courier: A Quick Overview of Their Services in London CitySprint is a courier and third-party logistics provider (3PL) based in the UK.\nThe company provides a nationwide coverage with 5000+ couriers and 35 local service centers in major UK cities (from Aberdeen to Southampton):\nWhile CitySprint is a national courier, they operate at a local level.\nIn the Greater London Area, their local centers are spread across 8 locations, including East and Central London, Gatwick, and Heathrow:\nThe wide range of CitySprints’ offer extends to 15+ services split into 3 different categories:\nWhile this makes them an excellent 3PL to outsource your logistics, how do they fare as a courier service for your business?\nThat’s why we’re only going to focus on their same-day and next-day delivery offer in London.\nSo what does CitySprint have going for it?\nLet’s take a look.\nAdvantages of Choosing CitySprint Here’s what we why you might want to choose CitySprint couriers for your deliveries in London:\n#1 A 24/7 Courier Service CitySprint offers their same-day and next-day delivery in London 24 hours a day, 365 a year.\nSo their customer service team is always on call to help you select and book the best courier service, and track your delivery.\nThis is especially useful if you’re not closing shop on Holidays. And you want to meet seasonal demand to deliver goods to your customers.\n#2 Online booking \u0026amp; tracking Like other good courier services in London, CitySprint offers online delivery booking.\nYou can do this with a debit/credit card.\nWith this option, you can either book a delivery on the spot. Or pre-book to get an instant quote.\nYou can also create a CitySprint account.\nThis gives you access to the CitySprint same-day online booking portal:\nHere you can customize your delivery. For example, pick the right type of same-day delivery:\nYou also get other benefits like:\n Real-time online tracking Proof of delivery (POD) Full 2-month report Custom delivery updates Access to collect-by-times  #3 Eco-friendly delivery CitySprint is committed to green logistics.\nWith their zero emissions same-day delivery service you can deliver orders anywhere in the capital and reduce the carbon footprint of your business.\nThis is possible with CitySprint’s green fleet.\nThe fleet consists of pushbikes, special cargo bikes, and electric motorbikes and vans, as well as hydrogen-powered vans:\nDisadvantages of Using CitySprint While there are benefits to using CitySprint, they have their shortcomings. Here are the biggest disadvantages of using CitySprint couriers (reported by customers):\n#1 Unreliable online tracking CitySprint’s online tracking system isn’t reliable.\nIn some cases, it simply doesn’t work.\nWhile more often, the delivery status doesn’t update regularly.\nSo failed delivery attempts do happen, especially since there is no notification system in place.\nAdditionally, couriers handle delivery confirmations themselves.\nBecause of that, sometimes they confirm drop offs even when it’s not completed. And then blame the customer for being absent to receive it.\n#2 Late deliveries To be fair:\nLate deliveries happen with any courier service in London.\nBut with CitySprint, parcels and packages tend to arrive much later than specified.\nSometimes several days later than promised.\nAlso, the courier company prides itself on parcel collection in 60 minutes (or less) in London.\nWhile in fact, couriers do sometimes come a few hours later than expected.\n#3 Poor customer support All of this would be fine, if customers could sort these problems easily with CitySprint’s customer support.\nBut that isn’t the case.\nWhen you book online and something goes wrong you’ll have to manually contact CitySprint’s dedicated helpline by phone.\nAnd the staff can help you take quick action but sometimes the customer service agents are at a loss.\nThen, they’ll refer you to a different department or agent. All of which wastes your time.\nAnd they may try to charge you for that, as well.\nWhich brings us to…\n#4 Unexpected fees CitySprint is one of the more expensive courier providers in London. (But more on that in a bit)\nBut what really irritates customers are the surcharges.\nWhile you get a quote when you book with CitySprint, they don’t include additional fees.\nWe’ve mentioned how their customer service may try to charge you extra. But that extends to delivery, as well.\nThere are a number of surcharges for fuel in place for same-day and overnight delivery in the UK:\nThis is in-line with their eco-friendly delivery initiative, which is fine.\nBut it does mean you’ll pay more for CitySprint services than for the same service with a different courier provider.\nHow much does it cost to deliver with CitySprint? CitySprint deliveries start from £14.26.\nThat’s without VAT.\nIt also doesn’t include the surcharges on fuel you can expect to pay.\n(Or other additional fees.)\nThis would be fine and well, if their service warranted the price.\nBut as far as we’re concerned, it doesn’t!\nAnd there are other, better alternatives to CitySprint that you can hire in London.\n#1 Brisqq - a reliable \u0026amp; tech-savvy courier alternative for CitySprint for businesses in London Brisqq is a delivery and courier service provider based in Central London.\nThis company specialises in delivery for businesses in London. For both B2C and B2B delivery.\nBut what really sets Brisqq apart from CitySprint is their technology.\nBrisqq has one of the most sophisticated delivery booking platforms in the UK.\nThe Brisqq platform comes with:\n Web-store integration Online showrooming Real-time tracking Status updates and reports Customer notifications And more.  Here’s what else makes Brisqq a good alternative to CitySprint:\nAdvantages of using Brisqq couriers #1 A courier business designed for business Unlike other couriers, Brisqq almost exclusively caters to B2C and B2B delivery in London.\nServices where Brisqq excels include:\n Same-day delivery Next-day or future-date delivery Multi-drop delivery  This makes them a solid choice for outsourcing your delivery. Or to scale operations and expand your reach without additional capital investment.\nAnd this works regardless of whether you sell from a physical store or online.\nIt also means you can use their services for transferring stock between stores or depots. Or to schedule returns. Or to plan recurring deliveries.\n#2 Precise delivery bookings Brisqq uses one-hour timeslots to enable you to book deliveries.\nYou can also let customers book deliveries themselves. (More on that in a second.)\nOnce you set up your account, you get access to all available timeslots.\nThen all you have to do is select the best one and schedule a delivery.\nYou can do this even if you need to deliver the package tomorrow, the day after, or on Monday.\nThe pickup occurs in one hour (or less). And the package is immediately dropped off after that (within the dedicated time window).\nIf you have multiple deliveries, you can schedule all of them by selecting the multi-drop delivery service.\n#3 Easy integration with your online store Brisqq is especially useful for e-commerce companies in London.\nYou can integrate their delivery platform with your webstore.\nThis works with both dedicated websites and major platforms like Magento or WooCommerce.\nIn any case, this feature allows customers to schedule deliveries at checkout themselves.\n(Just like if you owned an in-house courier fleet.)\nThat is pretty useful when you want to capitalise on showrooming.\n(So customers can browse in your store and check out on your website)\nBut also when you want to incentivize customers with various delivery options.\n(And raise your conversion rate.)\nBest of all:\nEverything is transparent…\n#4 End-to-end visibility over each delivery A courier service like Brisqq is only as good as its tracking technology.\nWhether it’s real-time delivery tracking, sending tracking links to customers, getting status updates, collecting proof of delivery, or gaining performance insights, Brisqq is REALLY good.\nAnd all you need is a web browser to sign in on your account.\nOr download the Brisqq app that works with both iOS and Android.\nDisadvantages of using Brisqq couriers #1 Availability Brisqq doesn’t offer 24/7 delivery like CitySprint. Instead, they have strict courier service times:\nWeekdays 6am - 10pm\nSaturday 6am - 8pm\nSunday 6am - 6pm\nThis may be a problem if your store’s work hours aren’t aligned with theirs.\n#2 Multi-drop pricing Brisqq does offer multi-drop delivery.\nBecause the price depends on the number of drops and the price, you won’t be able to see it until you’ve entered each destination on the dashboard.\nOnly then will the price appear.\nSo if you decide not to go through with it, the time you waste entering each delivery is annoying.\nHow much does it cost to deliver with Brisqq? Brisqq pricing starts from £7.90 per delivery (without VAT).\nBut since the service is aimed at business, you should contact Brisqq for a precise quote.\nFor example, you can set up a price for minimum volumes.\nAs for payment, you can do it per delivery (via debit or credit card).\nOr at the end of the month by connecting a payment method to the account or through invoicing.\nCancellations are free if done within 15 minutes after scheduling a delivery.\nAnd 60 minutes before the pick-up, 2 hours before a multi-drop delivery.\n#2 Gophr - A professional same-day courier service to support your delivery Gophr is another same-day delivery courier based in London.\nBut they are also a direct competitor to CitySprint.\nWith 9000+ signed up couriers, their network extends to 25+ other cities across the UK:\nBut unlike CitySprint, they rely on more advanced technology. A lot like Brisqq.\nIn fact, many companies use them to supplement their existing delivery fleets.\nAnd yet they are also focused on lowering their carbon footprint.\nGophr also uses alternative-energy vehicles, such as cargo bikes.\nBut they have also partnered with Parcelly to cut down CO2 emissions by reducing the distances their vehicles travel.\nAdvantages of using Gophr couriers #1 Dedicated account management If you’re a business owner, Gophr wants you to feel special.\nThat’s why all Gophr business account owners are assigned a dedicated manager.\nThis gives you greater control over the delivery operations that Gophr handles.\nBut it also provides you better support, especially when it comes to logistics.\nAnd especially if you deliver outside of London, to the entire UK.\n#2 Specialized delivery for specific businesses Gophr provides their courier services to businesses in all kinds of industries.\nThis includes businesses that require special vehicles and equipment to handle deliveries, such as pharmacies or food and beverage distributors.\nTo achieve this, Gophr uses:\n Refrigerated vehicles - vehicles that maintain cold temperatures within its storage space, regardless of its load capacity Thermal bags - bags fitted to bicycles or motorbikes that maintain the temperature of its contents Cold chain tracking - trackers inside vehicles and equipment that monitor their temperature and ensure orders are delivered safely  #3 Direct line to the courier Problems can occur at any point in the delivery lifecycle.\nAnd while you do have the option to contact your account manager, you can also call the courier directly.\nIf something does come up, you can resolve the issue with the person in the field.\nThis streamlines communication a good deal.\n(Especially if you already have a dedicated person responsible for in-house fleet dispatching.)\nDisadvantages of using Gophr couriers #1 Unreliable ETAs Gophr does provide GPS tracking.\nAnd it’s pretty good.\nBut what doesn’t work so well is the estimated time of arrival (ETA).\nCustomers often find that the ETA doesn’t match the actual time when your delivery arrives.\n#2 Last-minute cancellations Let’s face it:\nDeliveries can sometimes be delayed.\nAnd sometimes deliveries do fail.\nBut some customers do experience unexpected cancellations by Gophr.\nAnd they occur at the last minute before the delivery deadline. And without warning.\nWorst of all: you have to wait 14 days to get your money back.\nHow much does it cost to deliver with Gophr? Gophr is a pretty affordable courier service in London.\nGophr pricing starts at £4.50 per delivery (without VAT).\nBut the price you end up paying will depend a lot on the delivery itself.\nThe size of the parcel and the distance between destinations raises the cost.\nFor example, their cheapest delivery is a bicycle delivery in London for a package that’s under 45 x 45 x 45 cm.\nYou can get an estimate on their website by clicking on the Quick Quote calculator:\n#3 Absolutely Courier - A simple and reliable way to deliver goods in London Founded in 1865, Absolutely Courier is the oldest courier company in the UK.\nLike Brisqq, Absolutely operates exclusively in London with four offices in the capital.\nThe company specializes in same-day courier services. But they also provide:\n Overnight delivery (via APC across the UK) International shipping Temperature-controlled delivery  Like CitySprint, their same-day courier service operates 24/7 around the year.\nThey are also committed to reducing the carbon footprint in London.\nWith several eco-friendly vehicle options on offer when you book a delivery with them.\nAdvantages of using Absolutely Couriers #1 Excellent customer service The Absolutely customer support team is one of the best in London.\nThey are friendly, reliable, knowledgeable, and speedily resolve all issues.\nTypically, they respond to a problem as soon as you get in touch with them.\nAnd go beyond what’s expected of them.\nFor example, drivers don’t mind kindly waiting on recipients.\nOr helping customers carry packages to the vehicle.\nBut the best example is probably that customers remember the team members\u0026rsquo; names well after their delivery has been sent.\n#2 An established courier network Absolutely couriers operate only in London.\nBut that doesn’t mean they can’t deliver packages to the rest of the UK. Or to the continent.\nIn fact, that’s exactly what they offer with their overnight and international courier services.\nAnd how do they do that? Indirectly and through membership with multiple associations:\n APC Network Road Haulage Association National Courier and Despatch Association European Express Association  And they are accredited by the Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme.\nThis has benefits to you, as well:\nFor example, if you’re on-boarded to Hypaship, you can track packages from your APC Hypaship account.\n#3 Package tracking It doesn’t matter if you have an account or not on the Absolutely website.\nAll customers can track the status of their packages.\nThat means you can send the unique tracking number to customers.\nAnd all they have to do is go to the website, enter the number (as a guest) and see the location or status of their package.\n#4 Customizable address book If you regularly send parcels to the same addresses, Absolutely has got you covered.\nThe Address Book feature on your account allows you to add frequent delivery locations in London.\nThis makes it much easier to schedule new deliveries.\nOr if you use Absolutely to transport goods between suppliers and your store.\nDisadvantages of using Absolutely Couriers #1 Not Enough Insurance Absolutely offers insurance on goods in transit.\nThey provide coverage for parcels up to £500.\n(This is the lowest insurance coverage on the list.)\nFor example, Brisqq can cover up to £2000 value of goods.\nSo if you’re looking to move expensive or luxury items, you should consider outside insurance.\n#2 Fairly basic dashboard Absolutely is intended for all customers. Businesses and common users.\nSo while they have a good UI and UX, it does lack features which other courier services provide.\nMainly it lacks a more advanced capability when it comes to how you review deliveries.\nIf you’re using Absolutely as a business, it will be difficult to review delivery performance.\nAll you can do is review the orders you sent.\nAnd as far as a business is concerned, that’s not nearly enough to see if their services pay off.\nHow much does it cost to deliver with Absolutely Couriers? OK, the pricing isn’t listed for Absolutely Couriers.\nYou’ll have to create an account for a better understanding of their pricing.\nBut you can check the price for a specific delivery here.\nThis will give you a rough estimate based on distance and the vehicle you choose.\nFor example, a one kilometer bicycle delivery from the Houses of Parliament to Trafalgar Square is £8.19 (with VAT).\nYou can also do it by contacting one of their four offices in London.\nYou can find the contact details here.\nBottom Line  CitySprint is a good courier service. But it’s a better third-party logistics provider. So it’s best suited for businesses that need extra logistical support. And for companies that want to do business in London, as well as the rest of the country. Brisqq is a tech-oriented courier service that’s overall good for businesses in London. But it’s best suited for e-commerce and retail brands that need reliability, control, and transparency over the delivery experience. Plus something extra for their customers. Gophr is better suited for businesses that deliver all across the UK. Or companies in industries that require special care during transportation, such as pharmacies or food and beverage establishments. Absolutely is the oldest courier service in London. It’s also a fairly basic and reliable delivery for business, but it makes it a great solution to meet common delivery needs.  This is our verdict.\nSo if you’re looking to switch from CitySprint, we hope this article has helped you.\nRead our recent review of Addison Lee, if you’re wondering why we haven’t included them.\nAnd if you’re still undecided, then…\nGet in touch with us Get in touch with Brisqq.

Here are 3 other couriers you can use in London"},{"categories":[],"contents":"Are you using Addison Lee couriers to handle your deliveries in London?\nHow is the company serving your business?\nOr do you need a delivery in London with a little bit more edge?\nIn this post, we’ve put Addison Lee’s courier service to the test.\nWe compared it to three similar delivery services in London to see how they compare.\nSpecifically, we’ve looked at five key parameters:\nPrice.\nEase of use.\nDelivery speed.\nQuality of customer service.\nAvailability of couriers during peak hours.\nSo if your business is looking to replace Addison Lee, you’ll find the three best choices right here.\nWhat’s good about Addison Lee couriers? Addison Lee is a multi-vehicle multi-service fleet that has been operating in London since 1975. Their services range from car rentals and chauffeuring, to event and airport transfers across the UK to event transport.\nAs far as Addison Lee couriers are concerned, their services extend to three offers in London:\n Same day courier service Next day courier service International delivery service  What works for Addison Lee is that it is the largest taxi firm in London. It has a combined fleet of over 7,000 vehicles that includes cars, small and large vans, bicycles and motorcycles.\nSo you can just as easily use their service for small one-off parcels, as well as for continuous delivery of large and multiple packages.\nNot only that but the company has a special service called AL NOW.\nAL NOW is specifically aimed at businesses. It allows your business to book a courier in London within a two-hour time window, which you can use to deliver goods to customers (up to 100 kg) all across the capital (within the M25).\nHow do you book their courier service? To book Addison Lee couriers, visit their website and click on the Make a Booking button.\nOnce there, you’ll have to enter the pickup and dropoff locations and the date of the delivery:\nChoose the vehicle for your delivery:\nAdd the contact information of the pickup and drop-off contact:\nAnd select the payment method:\nBesides this, you can also add a proof of delivery contact.\nFor the AL NOW B2B service, it works the same, except that you’ll have to create an Addison Lee account to use it.\nWhat’s not good about Addison Lee couriers? The biggest downside is the price-to-quality-of-service ratio.\nAddison Lee’s delivery pricing starts with a flat fee of £15. This price includes a collection of a parcel or package from a London postcode to an address in a 4-mile radius.\nThis however doesn’t include extra fees that you may have to pay, and that the company simply lists as “Standard pricing thereafter”.\nSo while you may start at £15, Addison Lee drivers may charge you additional fees for waiting during pick-up or drop-off, parking, or additional distance charges.\nBut this would be okay if the service was on par with the price, which it isn’t.\nInstead, many people complain about:\n Late drop-offs or missed deliveries outside the time window Not receiving the package straight to their doorstep Drivers that rush customers or are rude and not very helpful  Besides this, you’ll also have a problem booking a delivery with Addison Lee during peak hours, and especially during holidays.\nBecause they’re the largest and most well-known courier company in London, they have a lot of business at this time.\nSo while you may be a regular customer, you’ll still have trouble finding what you’re looking for, even if you do need a same-day delivery.\nHow do Addison Lee couriers score? For all those reasons, we’re giving Addison Lee a score of 14.5 out of 25:\nAddison Lee courier alternatives in London While Addison Lee has the largest courier fleet in London, it’s NOT the only one on offer.\nIn this post, we’re going to review five other local couriers that we think can be a good fit, especially when it comes to B2B delivery services.\nHere are our top picks:\n#1 Brisqq - A fast, reliable, and tech-oriented B2B delivery service Brisqq is a delivery and courier service in London. Unlike most entries on the list, Brisqq is completely aimed at businesses, be it B2C or B2B.\nIt has also been designed around technology, with web store integration, online showrooming, live, on-map tracking, pickup and delivery status reports, customer notifications, and more.\nBecause of this, there are two offers on the table for you to choose from:\nE-Commerce: Seamlessly integrate Brisqq with the checkout on your website or e-commerce platform and offer delivery to online shoppers in London without actually owning a delivery fleet.\nOr\nIn-Store: Use the Brisqq web app to schedule deliveries and returns in one-hour time slots for an easy and more precise approach to how you hire couriers in London.\nHow does Brisqq outperform Addison Lee? If you operate a business in London, then you know that your customers want convenience, speed, and quality with every delivery. And to do it all over their phone.\nFor a business in London this means having:\n Next-day and same-day delivery to make quick returns on your sales Easy scheduling with precise time windows for package pick-ups and drop-offs Courier availability during your work hours, even during peak hours and holidays Delivery on-demand, be it for in-store purchases or over your website Quality assurance both for you and your customers at all times Transparency over each delivery with proof of delivery and reporting Live tracking for you and your customers to check the status of your deliveries  Brisqq offers all of this and more!\nBrisqq is the most tech-advanced entry on the list. It enables your business to harness the power of technology to easily hire couriers and schedule deliveries all across London with:\n Easy access to on-demand delivery: All you need is a web browser and to sign up for an account to book a Brisqq courier. Or download the Brisqq app (iOS or Android) One-hour time slots: Schedule deliveries when it’s convenient for you or your customer. With custom pick-up and drop-off points and inside 1-hour time windows.   Multi-drop delivery: Schedule multiple deliveries at once to multiple customers to save time and money, and speed up the time to drop-off.   Live tracking links: Monitor the status of each delivery in real-time as soon as you hand it over to the courier. And share the tracking information with your customers. Gain valuable insights: Use the Brisqq dashboard to track performance and ensure all deliveries and returns are up to your standard over time. Integration: Create a tailored experience for your customers by letting them request delivery at checkout, online or in-store. You can integrate Brisqq with any e-commerce platform (your website, Magento, Woocommerce, etc.)  How much does it cost to deliver with Brisqq? Because Brisqq is a courier service aimed at businesses in London, each payment plan is customized based on your needs. On average, delivery starts at £6.50.\nWhen it comes to payment it can be done after each delivery (via the credit card connected to your account) or at the end of the month.\nCancellations are free of charge within 15 minutes of scheduling the pick-up. Or if there are more than 60 minutes before the pick-up (for timeslot delivery) and two hours (for multi-drop delivery).\nHow do Brisqq couriers score? Brisqq is a reliable courier service alternative to Addison Lee, especially if you’re a business in London. For that reason, we give it 22.5 out of 25:\nBut don’t take our word for it:\n “Our customers appreciate having a one-hour delivery slot, because like us, they’re extremely busy.” Mark Welford, Director and Co-Founder of Bloomsbury Flowers\n #2 Gophr - Cheap delivery when you need support for your fleet Gophr is another tech-led courier service in the UK. Like Addison Lee, it isn’t just a local courier in London, but it offers next-day and same-day package delivery to many other cities:\nOn the other hand, like Brisqq, the company does use technology. With a network of couriers in multiple cities, they’re ideal for businesses that already have a delivery fleet, but need that little bit of extra support to service all of their customers.\nBut what really sets Gophr apart is their focus on eco-friendly delivery. In fact, they’re one of the first courier companies in London to use electric motorcycles or bikes.\nAdd to that their partnership with Parcelly - a company that owns 2,500 hyper-local warehouses across the UK - and they have much lower CO2 emissions when compared to Addison Lee.\nHow does Gophr outperform Addison Lee?\nGophr has many of the features a business in London is looking for:\n Next day and same-day deliveries Easy and automated scheduling Courier availability (not just in London) Delivery on demand Quality assurance Transparent visibility  As such, it’s a viable replacement for Addison Lee.\nThe only real issue customers have with their courier services is that sometimes they may miss delivery deadlines. But they’re more than happy to turn a blind eye to this due to their excellent customer service.\nHowever, their hyper-local warehouses, courtesy of Parcelly, raise efficiency of their deliveries both in London and beyond.\nThat’s great news because it makes them the most competitive alternative in terms of price:\nHow much does it cost to deliver with Gophr? The Gophr delivery pricing is the cheapest on this list. It starts at £4.50 but without VAT.\nHowever, the price depends a lot on the delivery itself.\nFor example, a bicycle delivery in London is the cheapest courier option. But depending on what kind of package you want to deliver and where, they’ll use a different vehicle. This raises the price significantly.\nHowever, there’s an instant quote calculator on their website:\nThis makes it easier to get a sense of how much you’ll pay for your delivery.\nHow do Gophr couriers score? If you already have a delivery fleet but you need additional support to handle all of your order volumes, Gophr is a good alternative to Addison Lee. Especially with a 4.5 excellence score on Trustpilot.\nFor that reason, Gophr scores almost as high as Brisqq with a commanding 20.5 out of 25:\n#3 CitySprint - Large courier fleet with expertise in logistics CitySprint is a courier service that’s also a third-party logistics provider (3PL). The range of their services extend from next-day and same-day courier delivery through international delivery, to logistics, freight, and storage.\nThis makes them a direct competitor to Addison Lee.\nBut when it comes to delivery in London (and in the UK) is that they offer their courier services 24 hours a day, 365 a year. That makes them the most available courier service on our list.\nIn addition, their expertise in logistics and international delivery means that they partner with some of the leading shipping companies in the world. Which means that if you have a delivery on the continent, CitySprint is the ideal courier option.\nHow does CitySprint outperform Addison Lee? Besides all the typical requirements of delivery in London, like same-day delivery, automated scheduling, or delivery tracking, using CitySprint courier services has additional advantages.\nThe biggest draw of CitySprint is the level of customization. They have over 20 different services you can choose from.\nThis allows you to choose a service that’s exactly the right fit for your business, in terms of type, size, order volumes, and complexity.\nFor example, if you deal in frozen foods, you can hire a refrigerated vehicle. If your business places emphasis on green logistics, you can choose their eco-friendly cargo bike delivery to and from anywhere in London.\nNext, they pay special attention to security. All of their couriers are DBS-checked and regularly complete eLearning courses with digital ID badges for extra safety and security at pick-up.\nThe only real issue with their delivery service is that their couriers can sometimes be late, and there’s no real way of notifying customers if that happens. Or when the courier is on his way to the customer.\nHow much does it cost to deliver with CitySprint? CitySprint deliveries start at £14.26 (without VAT). That makes them just a bit more affordable than Addison Lee.\nIn addition to this, CitySprint also includes fuel surcharges for specific deliveries:\nBut within the price you receive a £25 parcel coverage, in case the package gets damaged in transit. With an additional coverage option up to £1000.\nHow do CitySprint couriers score? CitySprint is a large courier fleet in London, with an extended service offer and expertise in logistics that make it ideal for businesses looking to outsource a delivery fleet.\nBut their price, legacy tech, and lower customer service mean they score 17.5 out of 25:\nThe Bottom Line When it comes to courier services in London, Addison Lee has its pros and cons. But so do all of these other companies\nBut when it comes to our ratings Brisqq is the clear winner, with Gophr coming in slightly behind.\nSo if you’re looking for the best all-around alternative for business delivery in London choose Brisqq.\nIf you want to have that but provide additional support for your fleet, and extend your reach to other cities in the UK, choose Gophr.\nAnd if you want to completely outsource your delivery to a 3PL or deliver something outside the UK, you’ll be happy with CitySprint.\nStart delivering in London today!
